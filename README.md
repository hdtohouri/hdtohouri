## 👋 Hi there! 
 
I'm Tohouri Henoc Desire, a passionate junior software developer with a focus on backend development. 🖥️💻 I am currently using CodeIgniter. 
In addition to CodeIgniter, I'm also dedicated to expanding my knowledge in other cutting-edge technologies like MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, Vuejs and Flutter.

I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute my skills and learn from experienced professionals. My goal is to work with a team that encourages continuous growth and allows me to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios. I'm excited to embrace new challenges and make meaningful contributions as a junior software developer.
If you're looking for a motivated and enthusiastic developer with a focus on backend development using CodeIgniter, as well as an appetite for learning Vuejs and Flutter, let's connect! 🤝 I'm open to exciting opportunities.
